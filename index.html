                        <strong>My dearest, Maʻam Dhara️♡</strong>
                        <p>
                          <p>
You are still as bright as I first saw you.
<br>
A one of a kind, hard to bid adieu.
<br>
To love so pure, purely to ward off woe.
<br>
Te amaré hasta morir—Te amo.
<br>
<br>
I thank the universe for meeting you,
<br>
The stars too for experiencing you
<br>
Plethora of colors embodied by you
<br>
Holding up a fluorescent, ethereal hue.
<br>
<br>
Gosh, I would kill to re-experience such
<br>
Perhaps it is too much to ask for such.
<br>
Although I am aware things never last
<br>
The light you bring in me will remain vast.
<br>
<br>
Never did I felt an older personʻs warmth
<br>
At the very least, a warmth close to yours. 
<br>
It baffles me how you hold so much worth
<br>
Even so, I will welcome you like the shores.
<br>
<br>
The shores I believed to be out of reach,
<br>
Only to have my feet wet at the beach.
<br>
Quite luring you to walk in depths of dreams
<br>
Uttering that there are more than just whims.
<br>
<br>
Graceful & fleeting like the white lilies
<br>
Would go as well as for a diamond.
<br>
Still one that stands out among all of these—
<br>
That Iʻd be the pearl to your rose diamond.
<br>
<br>
Your pearl whom will silently yearn for you.
<br>
Fail to alter your ever-glowing hue.
<br>
For I sought you in places you’ve never been.
<br>
Insisting that someday you will be seen.
<br>
<br>
With all the nonsensical folks around
<br>
They can be a pain and all except for one,
<br>
And that is with hindsight to be more bound
<br>
To appreciate how there is you than none. X0
<br>
<br>
I find my circumstances amusing.
<br>
Life really could be unpredictable—
<br>
Who wouldve known onto who I am clinging?
<br>
That a teacher brings love so palpable?
<br>
<br>
I will never forget your calm adobe.
<br>
It held a significant role in me
<br>
And a source of sharing whatʻs yours to me.
<br>
I felt trusted by you, that is the role.
